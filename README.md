# PokeGo Chat

_Time limit: 3-4 hours_

My initial idea was to build an application where you could search for locations and check if there are any current construction zones near by that may impact commute. However, finding an API that returns data about construction zones was difficult and was spending too much time so I opted for something far less relative to CompanyCam industry.
